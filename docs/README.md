# Nix


# Who is Nix for?
Nix is a tool for people who both need computers to do exactly as intended, repeatably, far into the future, and who are familiar with command line interfaces and plain text editors.

You probably won’t want to go back to a world without Nix if you’re a:

* Full-stack or back-end developer
* Test engineer
* Embedded systems developer
* DevOps engineer
* System administrator
* Data scientist
